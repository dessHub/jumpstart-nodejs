# What Is Node Js????.
 
   * Node is a server-side platform.
   * Built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine).
   * Uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient
   * It runs on variuous platforms such as Windows, Linux, Unix & Mac OS X.

# Features of Node.js
   
   1.**Asynchronous** - The server can respond to multiple requests at a time.It won’t stop or block any          API request and will respond to all when the response is ready to send accordingly.
   2.**Event Driven** - The flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions thats mouse          clicking.An event based system is always be in circular loop to execute it’s responsibilities.
   3.**Single Threaded** - All requests runs the same thread unlike Java/PHP/ASP.net based webservers           every client request is instantiated on a new thread.
        _The main event loop is single-threaded but most of the I/O works run on separate threads, because the I/O APIs in Node.js are asynchronous/non-blocking by design, in order to accommodate the event loop._
   4.**No Buffering** − Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.
